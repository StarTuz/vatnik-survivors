## How This Was Built 🛠️

Vatnik Survivors was created **agentically**. This means it was built through iterative prompts using **Google Antigravity** with **Gemini Flash**, rather than through traditional manual coding.

**Agentic coding** is a new way of building software where AI agents plan, execute, and refine tasks autonomously based on human intent. Instead of writing every line of code, the creator describes the goal, and the agent handles the heavy lifting of implementation, testing, and debugging. It’s an exciting leap that makes game development accessible to everyone.

## Get Started with Agentic Coding Yourself – No Coding Experience Needed! 🚀

You can build your own games just like this by describing your ideas. Here are the best tools to start your journey:

### [Cursor 2.0](https://cursor.com)

* **Free Hobby Tier**: Includes ~2000 completions and 50 slow premium requests per month, with a 2-week Pro trial. No credit card is needed—just sign up with your email.
* **Great for Local Editing**: Download the app, open this repository folder, and use `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` to have the AI edit your code or the chat sidebar to ask, "Add exploding particles on enemy death."

### [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)

* **100% Free**: Currently in public preview (as of 2026) with generous limits on Gemini 3 Flash and Pro models. Just sign in with your Google account and download the desktop app.
* **How to Start**: Launch the app, create a new project, and paste your code or prompt: "Improve this Vatnik Survivors prototype by adding level-up upgrades."
* **Hands-Free Development**: The agents handle the planning, coding, and previewing for you.

> [!TIP]
> **Try this prompt**: "Add exploding white particles when an enemy is defeated" and watch the AI implement it for you in real-time!
